# 🧠 DSA Visualizer – Interactive Learning through Gamified Visuals

Welcome to **DSA Visualizer**, a fully interactive website designed to help you learn Data Structures and Algorithms in the most intuitive and enjoyable way — through **visualization and gamification**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎲 **Game-style algorithm animations**
* 🔁 **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort
* 🧭 **Graph Traversals**: BFS, DFS with grid-based visual pathfinding
* 🎨 **Black & White Gradient Theme** with clean animations
* 🕹️ **Start / Reset Controls** for every algorithm
* 📱 **Responsive design** using CSS Flexbox/Grid
* 🧩 Easily extensible for more algorithms

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-visualizer.git
cd dsa-visualizer
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Select an algorithm from the dropdown.
4. Hit **Start** to visualize. Use **Reset** to generate new data or grids.
